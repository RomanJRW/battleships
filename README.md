# Battleships game
A simple battleships game, made in Java

[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=RomanJRW/battleships)](https://dependabot.com)

A side project for the purpose of practicing different techniques and tools. The game will undergo various ongoing changes with new features being added when possible. The final aim is to have a fully functional game with single and multiplayer modes, available to play with a GUI or the command line. Much of the project follows unconventional methods, as a result of both experimentation and fun limitations applied to make it more challenging.

The game can be played using either the CLI or GUI. In fact, it can be played using both, one for input and another for output. The GUI is a basic Swing implementation.
