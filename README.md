# Battleships game
A simple battleships game, made in Java

A side project for the purpose of practicing different techniques and tools. The game will undergo various ongoing changes with new features being added when possible. The final aim is to have a fully functional game with single and multiplayer modes, available to play with a GUI or the command line.

# Current status
The GUI is not yet implemented. Some unit tests have been uploaded, but many classes still do not have working unit tests. Will continue to add these over time, as and when I get an opportunity.

# Contributing
This is a personal project and not for the purpose of collaboration or contribution. However, any feedback, advice or suggestions are, of course, welcome.
