# Battleships game
A simple battleships game, made in Java

A side project for the purpose of practicing different techniques and tools. The game will undergo various ongoing changes with new features being added when possible. The final aim is to have a fully functional game with single and multiplayer modes, available to play with a GUI or the command line.

# Current status
There is a now a basic GUI that contains some of the core functionality. No documentation specifying how to use each interface yet, as GUI will develop over time. The GUI version doesn't yet support file management and there are lots of placeholder items. Not designed to be pretty or for good usability, still more of a proof of concept at the moment.

# Contributing
This is a personal project and not for the purpose of collaboration or contribution. However, any feedback, advice or suggestions are, of course, welcome.
