# Battleships game
A simple battleships game, made in Java

A side project for the purpose of practicing different techniques and tools. The game will undergo various ongoing changes with new features being added when possible. The final aim is to have a fully functional game with single and multiplayer modes, available to play with a GUI or the command line.

# Current status
The GUI is not yet implemented. Some unit tests exist in the test folder, but they are outdated due to recent major change in program structure, so should not be relied on. Will update with correct working tests soon.

# Contributing
This is a personal project and not for the purpose of collaboration or contribution. However, any feedback, advice or suggestions are, of course, welcome.
